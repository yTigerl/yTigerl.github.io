I am currently a Ph.D candidate with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology. I received his B.E. degree in computer science and technology from Southern University of Science and Technology in 2021, and received my M.E. degree in electronic science and technology from Southern University of Science and Technology in 2024. My research interests are mainly in blockchain, decentralized finance and network economics.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jin Zhang](https://jinzhang-sustech.github.io/) from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology.
